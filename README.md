# Alarm-Clock


The objective of this project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.


## Tkinter Module

Tkinter module belongs to a standard library of GUI in Python. It helps us to create a dialog box with any information that we want to provide or get from the users.
To Initialize tkinter, we pass a command under the name clock as Tk().


## Date and Time

Datetime and time modules in python help us to work with the dates and time of the current day when the user is operating python and to manipulate it too.
